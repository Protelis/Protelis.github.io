title: The Protelis programming language for aggregate programming
---
<div class="blurb">
	<p>The goal of the Protelis language is to make it easier to build a resilient and well-behaved networked system out of an assortment of different potentially mobile devices. Protelis is designed for the paradigm of "aggregate programming", a way of thinking about and decomposing problems that can be solved with a network of distributed sensors and computers. Aggregate programming tries to produce reliable and robust collective behavior from uncoordinated local interactions between machines. That's hard to do, but Protelis helps!</p>

<img src="/images/overview.png" alt="Assorted devices distributed across space can turned into an inherently resilient distributed system by using a computational field programming model to handle peer-to-peer monitoring, tasking, and communicating.">
	
	<p>Protelis was designed specifically to support aggregate programming:
	<ul>
	<li>Protelis is a language, not just a library. Because it's a language, Protelis can handle some of tough parts of distributed systems implicitly, preventing some common mistakes and problems.</li>
	<li>Protelis is hosted in and integrated with Java. It is lightweight and can take advantage of the large and well-established ecosystem of Java infrastructure and libraries.</li>
	<li>Although Protelis is not Java, it's designed to look similar. Developers who already know Java can more easily learn Protelis.</li>
	<li>Protelis can ensure safe and resilient composition because it is built on <i>field calculus</i>. Field calculus is a theoretical model of aggregate programming much like lambda calculus is for functional programming.</li>
	</ul></p>

          aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why
        Protelis?</h2>
      <p>Developing networked systems is really hard.
        To make a good resilient system, you generally need to bring
        three types of expertise to bear all at once in the same code:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Expertise regarding the actual purpose of the system</li>
        <li>Networking expertise, to manage the interactions between
          individual devices</li>
        <li>Distributed algorithms expertise, to ensure that the
          collective behavior is desirable and resilient to all sorts of
          failures and system changes</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This "aggregate programming" problem, of obtaining resilient
        collective behavior from local interactions between machines,
        has been with us ever since people started networking computers.
        In some specialized areas, such as cloud computing and GPU
        programming, there a simple and regular network architecture has
        already led to good aggregate programming methods (e.g., <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce">MapReduce</a>).</p>
      <p>The goal of the Protelis language is to make resilient
        networked systems just as easy to build for complex and
        heterogeneous networks as for single machines and cloud systems.
        This accomplished by separating the different tasks and making
        some of the hard and subtle parts automatic and implicit.
        A few of the key design decisions behind Protelis are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Protelis is a language because there are a lot of subtle and
          easy ways to break a distributed system. Creating a language
          (rather than just a library) lets some of these be handled
          implicitly, so there is no opportunity to make mistakes.</li>
        <li>Protelis is hosted in and integrated with Java to let it be
          very lightweight take advantage of the large pre-existing
          ecosystem of Java infrastructure and libraries.</li>
        <li>Protelis looks as much like Java as practical in order to
          make it easier to learn and adopt.</li>
        <li>Protelis ensures safe and resilient composition because its
          core is <em>field calculus</em>, a theoretical model of
          aggregate programming much like <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">lambda
            calculus</a> is for functional programming.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The first version of Protelis was designed jointly during the
        summer of 2014 by Jacob Beal, Danilo Pianini, and Mirko Viroli,
        with the first implementation carried out primarily by Danilo
        Pianini.</p>
      <p>The name "Protelis," a Latin word which translates
        approximately as "regarding a team," was chosen to reflect both
        its nature as an aggregate language and its derivation from
        Proto.</p>

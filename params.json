Creating a language (rather than just a library) lets some of these be handled implicitly, so there is no opportunity to make mistakes.\r\n* Protelis is hosted in and integrated with Java to let it be very lightweight take advantage of the large pre-existing ecosystem of Java infrastructure and libraries.\r\n* Protelis looks as much like Java as practical in order to make it easier to learn and adopt.\r\n* Protelis ensures safe and resilient composition because its core is *field calculus*, a theoretical model of aggregate programming much like [lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus) is for functional programming.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"reading\"></a>Further reading / references:\r\n\r\n* [Protelis: Practical Aggregate Programming](http://jakebeal.com/Publications/SAC2015-Protelis.pdf),\r\n\tDanilo Pianini, Mirko Viroli, Jacob Beal, ACM Symposium on Applied Computing 2015, April 2015.\r\n\t<br>*The first scientific paper presenting Protelis and example applications*\r\n* **Distributed Recovery for Enterprise Services**\r\n\tShane S.
